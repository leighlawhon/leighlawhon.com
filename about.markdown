# Hi there, I’m Leigh Lawhon!
I am a dedicated UX Engineer returning to my passion for hands-on design and development after extensive experience in product management. Proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I am skilled in creating intuitive, accessible user interfaces and have a proven track record of translating user needs into functional and engaging digital experiences. My background in managing the entire product lifecycle enriches my approach to design, ensuring that every project is aligned with both user expectations and strategic business objectives. I am excited to refocus on front-end development and UX design, areas where my passion for tech and user experience converge.

## My Journey
I started my career as a graphic designer. I excelled at the details of the software programs I was using and began to teach. Through the years, I became curious about how software was created and why some products were hard to use while others were intuitive. I taught myself HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React), and Python and soon began designing and building my own user-centric applications.

I’m passionate about building beautiful and user-centric products for the web. I am a lifelong learner who loves to teach, which has led to my role as a UX Engineer.
