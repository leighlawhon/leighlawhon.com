# Leigh Lawhon
**Product Designer | Developer | Product Manager**

I am a dedicated UX Engineer returning to my passion for hands-on design and development after extensive experience in product management. Proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I am skilled in creating intuitive, accessible user interfaces and have a proven track record of translating user needs into functional and engaging digital experiences. My background in managing the entire product lifecycle enriches my approach to design, ensuring that every project is aligned with both user expectations and strategic business objectives. I am excited to refocus on front-end development and UX design, areas where my passion for tech and user experience converge.
